# Cholesterol Level Analysis Using R

## Overview
This repository showcases an assignment where the impact of a diet program on cholesterol levels was analyzed using R. The analysis follows a structured approach to hypothesis testing and includes:

1. **Hypothesis Statement**:
   - Null Hypothesis (H0): The diet program has no impact, and the average cholesterol level remains at 5.95.
   - Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): The diet program has an impact, and the average cholesterol level differs from 5.95.

2. **Normality Assessment**:
   - The dataâ€™s normality is assessed using QQ plots and histograms. The visualizations indicate a generally normal distribution, with slight skewness.

3. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Conducted a two-sided Z-test to determine if the diet program affected cholesterol levels. The analysis includes calculating Z values and P-values to test the hypotheses.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The analysis concludes that the diet program significantly impacted cholesterol levels, with the mean cholesterol level after the program being significantly lower than the initial mean. The P-value supports rejecting the null hypothesis.

## Key Insights
- **Normal Distribution**: The QQ plots and histograms suggest that the data follows a normal distribution, making it suitable for Z-testing.
- **Significant Impact**: The results show that the diet program effectively reduced cholesterol levels, with strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
- **Statistical Rigor**: The step-by-step approach to hypothesis testing ensures a comprehensive and reliable analysis.

## Usage
This repository serves as an example for students and professionals learning hypothesis testing, data visualization, and statistical analysis in R. The analysis and visualizations provide practical insights into performing similar studies on other datasets.

## Conclusion
The detailed analysis in this assignment demonstrates the effectiveness of the diet program in lowering cholesterol levels. The rigorous approach to hypothesis testing and data analysis provides a solid foundation for more advanced statistical studies.
